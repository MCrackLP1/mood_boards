# Moodboard Web App

A minimalist, personal web app to create, save, and present moodboards. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, running fully on the client-side using Local Storage.

## Concept

This app is designed to be a digital artbook, focusing on pure aesthetics and function without unnecessary UI. It allows for the creation of moodboards with images and notes, automatic color palette extraction, and an interactive color-based filter.

Created by Mark Tietz & Gemini.
